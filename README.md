# d7s-grove-tinkerboard  
It is a module for evaluating Omron sensor D7S with Tinker Board and a sample program when using a module.

D7S is the world's smallest class seismic sensor.
By adopting the SI value highly correlated with the seismic intensity class indicating the magnitude of the earthquake, it is possible to make a highly accurate earthquake judgment according to the seismic intensity class.
It is also possible to acquire earthquake related information in the sensor with the I2C interface.

## language

## Description
- grove_d7s.py  
Driver module for acquiring data from D7S via GrovePi+.

- sample_d7s.py  
It is a sample program that allows you to check the data acquired via the driver module on the console.

- sample_gui_d7s.py  
It is a sample program that enables you to visualize and check the data acquired via the driver module with graphs.

***DEMO:***  
When you run sample_gui_d7s.py, you can see the following graph.
